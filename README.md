Recipe of Kheer 
I would like to share some important tips to make the perfect rice kheer recipe. 1. Rinse a deep non-stick pan with Â¼ cup of water and quickly simmer it for 2-3 minutes. This will prevent milk from burning from the bottom as the water forms a protective layer between the pan and milk. Also, it is advisable to use a heavy bottom pan to make Indian desserts like basundi, kheer, rabdi. 2. Stir it occasionally to avoid milk from sticking to the bottom of the pan or browning. It is very important to use full-fat milk as it will provide the rice-kheer a rich and creamy texture. 3. Cook until rice is soft and breaks easily with a spoon or on pinching with your finger. Do not add sugar before the rice has turned mushy or else your rice will take forever to cook.
